                        <strong>Dear Monda.</strong>
                        <p>
                           Only you can read this cuz you know the password. I want to wish you a happy birthday from my heart and i love you to the fullest extened, the only problem i have with you is that i just can't express all the love that I have for you. And for all the hard times and for every arguments and any saddnes and any little tick of that i was the cause of I am sorry. Belive me even when we fight all i want to see you is smile, when you don't smile, when you are not happy it's like we are connected with Bluetooth cuz i swear somehow I am sad too. You are the reson why I smile in the morning and you are person i think of hugging every night when i go to sleep. 
                            Tduu quuuummmm.
